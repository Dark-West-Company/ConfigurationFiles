## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to the Config File
1. Go to the [ConfigurationFiles repository](https://github.com/Dark-West-Company/ConfigurationFiles)
2. Click on the `configs/` folder
3. Find the config file you want to edit (e.g., `bcc_housing_main.lua`)
4. Click on the file name to open it

### Step 2: Edit the File
1. Click the **‚úèÔ∏è Edit this file** button (pencil icon) in the top right
2. Make your changes directly in the web editor
3. Use the preview tab to check formatting if needed

### Step 3: Save and Create Pull Request
1. Scroll down to the **"Commit changes"** section
2. Add a descriptive commit message (e.g., "Update housing prices for Valentine")
3. Add an optional description explaining your changes
4. **IMPORTANT**: Select **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"**
5. Click **"Propose changes"**

### Step 4: Complete the Pull Request
1. GitHub will take you to the Pull Request creation page
2. Add a clear title and description of what you changed
3. Click **"Create pull request"**
4. Wait for a developer to review and approve your changes

## üìÅ Config File Guidelines

### File Organization
- Config files are located in the `configs/` directory
- Files are named after the mod they configure
- Examples: `bcc_housing_main.lua`, `vorp_core_config.lua`, `weathersync_config.lua`

### Editing Tips
- **Lua Files**: Use proper syntax - pay attention to commas, quotes, and brackets
- **Numbers**: Don't use quotes around numbers (use `100`, not `"100"`)
- **Text**: Always use quotes around text values (use `"Valentine"`, not `Valentine`)
- **Comments**: Add `--` before comments to explain your changes

### Common Config Types
- **BCC Mods**: Housing, Farming, Ranch, etc. (files start with `bcc_`)
- **VORP Mods**: Core system files (files start with `vorp_`)
- **Standalone**: Weather, custom scripts (various names)

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Best Practices

1. **Clear Titles**: Use descriptive PR titles
   - ‚úÖ "Increase housing prices in Valentine by 20%"
   - ‚úÖ "Add new crafting recipes for survival category"
   - ‚ùå "Fix stuff" or "Update config"

2. **Good Descriptions**: Include:
   - What specific values you changed
   - Why you made the changes
   - Which areas/features are affected

3. **Example Description**:
   ```
   ## Changes Made
   - Increased hotel room prices from $5 to $8
   - Added new furniture options for player houses
   - Fixed typo in Valentine hotel name
   
   ## Reason
   Current prices are too low compared to other activities
   Players requested more furniture variety
   ```

## üöÄ After Your Pull Request

### What Happens Next
1. **Automatic Validation**: GitHub Actions will check your file syntax
2. **Developer Review**: A team member will review your changes
3. **Feedback**: You might get comments or requests for changes
4. **Approval**: Once approved, changes are automatically deployed to the server
5. **Go Live**: Your changes will be active on the Dark West server within minutes!

### If You Need to Make Changes
1. Go back to your Pull Request page
2. Click on the **"Files changed"** tab
3. Click the **‚úèÔ∏è** button next to the file you want to edit
4. Make your changes and commit them
5. The Pull Request will automatically update

## üÜò Getting Help

### Common Issues
- **Syntax Error**: If the automated checks fail, read the error message carefully
- **Permission Denied**: Make sure you're signed into GitHub and have access to the repository
- **Can't Find File**: Check the `configs/` folder - file names are specific

### Need Help?
- Ask in the Dark West Discord `#development` channel
- Tag a developer in your Pull Request with `@username`
- Include screenshots if you're having trouble with the GitHub interface

## üìã Quick Reference

### File Locations
- **BCC Housing**: `bcc_housing_main.lua`, `bcc_housing_hotels.lua`, etc.

### Remember
- Always use the **"Create a new branch"** option when committing

- Be patient - reviews help keep the server stable!

*Happy configuring! Your changes help make the Dark West experience better for everyone.* ü§†

**Note**: Adding new mods is handled by Dark West developers. If you need a new mod added to the system, ask a developer to set up the mapping.

Game designers only need to edit existing config files in the `configs/` directory.

## Common Issues

### Invalid JSON
If you see JSON validation errors:
1. Use a JSON validator like [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)
2. Check for missing commas, quotes, or brackets
3. Ensure no trailing commas in JSON files

### Missing Files
If the workflow reports missing files:
1. Verify the file exists in the `configs/` directory
2. Ensure file is committed to git
3. Contact a Dark West developer if you need a new mod added

## Getting Help

- Check existing issues for similar problems
- Ask questions in the Dark West Discord
- Contact Dark West developers for:
  - Adding new mods to the system
  - Technical issues with deployments
  - Config mapping problems

## Guidelines

- Be respectful and professional in all communications
- Focus on constructive feedback for config changes
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting
- Keep discussions relevant to Dark West server configuration
